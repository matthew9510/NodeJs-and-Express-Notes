Copying our code we completed in the node section, we will get rid of our routes.js file and 
remove it from the app.js file. Due to this we are now missing a request handler. 

Install by: "nm install --save express"

After we import express we can now create an express application by calling the function that the
module exports and store it in a constant called app. When you execute this function, we will 
initialize a new object. you could say where expressjs, the framework will store and manage a 
lot of things for us behind the scenes, so a lot of logic is in this app constant here.

The constant app is also a valid request handler, so you can pass this into a the createServer() 
function. If you do that and you run npm start, you will actually have a running server which 
of course will not handle any requests though because we haven't defined any logic that should 
happen for incoming requests. app will basically not do anything at this point.

It does do one thing though. It sets up a certain way of handling incoming requests that defines 
or that is a key characteristic of expressjs.
