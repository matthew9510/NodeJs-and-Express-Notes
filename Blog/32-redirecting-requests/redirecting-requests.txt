Lets do something when someone clicks the button and sends a post request to /message.

Lets add another if statement to check if the url is equal to '/message' and also to check that we are not handling a GET request.
If this if statement gets triggered lets redirect the user to the root '/' as well as create a new file and store the message in it. 

After writing to a file we will use a method on res called writeHead which will allow us to write a bunch of meta information in one go. We can set the status code of 302, which stands for redirection. We will then pass in a javascript object with some headers we want to send.
The key of the header we want to use is 'Location' which is the route to redirect to. 
Then return a res.end() so we stop the anonymous function
