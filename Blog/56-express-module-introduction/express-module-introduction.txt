With nodejs you have to write a lot of code to extract the body of an incoming request. 
i.e. converting the body of a post to use it, using event listeners and buffers.
We don't want to do that, we want to focus more on the business logic, we don't want to worry about
care about standard tasks like handling incoming requests or routing, i.e. executing different 
code for different paths, different urls. We don't want to do this. So we turn to express.

Express will help us outsource some of this tedious work.

It gives you a rule set in which you work and a lot of utility functions that help you write cleaner
code and focus on your core business.
