We will install a 3rd party package to restart the server automatically when we save changes

we do this by typing "npm install nodemon --save "

Installation flags: 
--save -> for poduction dependency
--save-dev -> for development dependency
-g -> WILL NOT INSTALL ON PROJECT but will install globally on your computer


If a dependency version has a '^' carrot and you run "npm install" it will go through our packages and update to the latest version if possible 

These packages are stored in node_modules folder. Note that nodemon has peer dependencies that will also be installed and added to the node_modules folder as well.

package-lock.json saves the version's you have installed so if you work with someone they can aso work with the same versions as you are.
