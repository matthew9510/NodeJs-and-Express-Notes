For extracting a body we had to listen to the data event and the end event and then created a buffer
and converted it to a string. Express js will have a way to deal with handling or parsing that data 
having easy integration of another package.

We in general don't want to care about all these nitty gritty details, we want to focus on our code
that defines our application, so the thing that really sets our application apart from other 
applications, our unique selling point you could say and we do use a framework for this, for 
all the heavy lifting. A framework is basically a set of helper functions but also a suite of tools
and rules with which we work, so basically we have a clearly defined way or at least some outline 
on how we should structure our application, our code and how we should work with that framework 
to write clean code.

The great thing about express is that it's highly flexible and actually doesn't add too much 
functionalities out of the box but it gives you a certain way of building your application or of
working with the incoming requests that make it highly extensible and therefore, there are dozens
or hundreds and thousands of third party packages built for express specifically that you can then
easily add to your node express application without having to configure a lot and this is
probably the real strength of express and of course it also does add some nice features out of the
box.
