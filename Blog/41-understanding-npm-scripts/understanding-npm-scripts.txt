We can write scripts to handle writing 'node app.js' every time. 
We will need o use npm - node package manager, already installed with node js

We can use npm to initialize our node project. 

'npm init' - sets up the package

with the package.json file we can add  "start": "node app.js", to the scripts object. 

No blanks or whitespaces allowed in naming convention for json keys

start is a special script where you can run by typing this in the terminal - "npm start" 

Other scripts you write can run by typing "npm run script-name"
