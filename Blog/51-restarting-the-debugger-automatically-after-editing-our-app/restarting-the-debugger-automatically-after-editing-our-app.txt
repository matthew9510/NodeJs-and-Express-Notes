Debug > open configuration > nodejs

Add this to the configurations array object:
   "restart": true,
    "runtimeExecutable": "nodemon",
    "console":"integratedTerminal"

We will see an error because nodemon is not installed globally. So go install it globally running the following command: "npm i nodemon -g"
If we make changes it restarts the debugger and node and these are two seperate processes.
If you stop the debugger, nodemon has to quit separately by you typing ctrl+c.  

Note we have to use the terminal now not the debug terminal due to our changes.
